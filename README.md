# MNIST Classifier

## Aim of this project

The goal of this project is to classify handwritten digits. I'm following the classification chapter in Aurelien Geron's [book](https://www.amazon.fr/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-learn-Tensorflow/dp/1492032646/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&qid=1612903135&refinements=p_27%3AAurelien+Geron&s=books&sr=1-1) to code this project.
The final project should be an html page where the user can draw draw a digit and the differents models would output their predictions and confidence.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the packages.

```bash
pip install sklearn, matplotlib, numpy
```

## Usage
